# standup.py

This is a small script to generate a standup message based on JIRA tickets, and
optionally send it to slack.

## Installation

This script should be somewhere on your shell search path. Additionally, you
should add your JIRA account 'quick login' to `.netrc` in your home folder.

To use the slack functionality, you should enable an 'incoming webhook' and
note the URL.

## Usage

    standup.py $JIRA_URL $SLACK_URL

This will print each open ticket assigned to you, and prompt you to leave an
optional comment.

At the end, it will ask to post to slack. Type `y` to send, and `^C` to quit
without posting.
